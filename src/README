I have decided to use serialization to save and load data. Due to this, I have decided to change the program's implementation:
I will use an ArrayList to store the contacts, as it is a convenient single object for use with serialization
Variable IdHelper is static and so is unsuitable for serialization, therefore I will assign new Contact Id's based on
(size of ArrayList + 1)
